Great news, everyone! We've just rolled out one of the most requested features: Sortable Lists. Spots (in a category) or Towns can now be sorted by their ranking and/or number of spots, distance, or alphabetically.

It already seems useful in finding the quickest way to get out of town and get somewhere interesting. Let us know if this helps you in your travels. [We'd love your feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FG6_gaNWk_OLEnSMwQ76oXnDM4bpMlhF-pu0aA-s_zw/viewform?c=0&w=1).
