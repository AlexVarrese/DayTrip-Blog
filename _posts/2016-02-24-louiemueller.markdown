This week [the amigos](http://paravelinc.com) took a lunchtime day trip to Taylor, TX for some [Louie Mueller BBQ](https://godaytrip.com/spots/louie-mueller-barbecue). Being so close to Austin, it’s amazing what you can enjoy if you extend your lunch break by 30 minutes. We left at 11:00 and got back to the office at 12:30. Louie Mueller is easily one of our favorites in the [BBQ category](https://godaytrip.com/categories/bbq). We’ll be taking more of these trips, and hope to bring more friends along.
