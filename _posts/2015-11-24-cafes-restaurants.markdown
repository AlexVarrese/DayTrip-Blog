![Cafes vs Restaurants](/assets/img/cafevsrestaurant.jpg)

We just added a new [restaurant category](https://godaytrip.com/categories/restaurants) to DayTrip. We already had [cafes](https://godaytrip.com/categories/cafes), so you might be asking why we added restaurants? Well, in our eyes a restaurant and a cafe in Texas are very different. We made a handy little chart so you'll know the difference:
