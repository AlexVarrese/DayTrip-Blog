Today we rolled out another one of our most requested features: [Maps](https://godaytrip.com/towns/map)! But rather than bore you with _a bunch of words_, we'll tell you about it BuzzFeed-style.

### At first we we like...

## The wordier version

Maps is another one of our most requested features. Austin is growing at a pace of 150 people per day, so it's not a shock that people (especially newcomers) are unfamiliar with the locations and town names around Austin. They all end in "&ndash;burg" or "&ndash;ville" and are pronounced differently than how they're spelled.

It seems obvious that a geolocation-based application like DayTrip should have a map. Geolocation = Map! Duh! Yet, as we started to sketch and build out the feature, we noticed that maps are actually a terrible way to find things. From a UX perspective, it's a lot of hunt-and-pecking around a mystery-meat navigation of location pin icons to hopefully find something that interests you. Maps tend to work better with a smaller, digestible, set of options.

A map of all the spots on DayTrip wasn't the solution. A map of all the spots in a town wasn't really the solution either. The feature wasn't really working until we tried it with Towns.

Browsing towns in a map view is fairly intuitive and helpful. It helps makes sense of where destinations are in relation to one another.

And since towns are essentially a collection of spots, we can guarantee that you'll be able to spend a full day out and about. We think you'll really like how it turned out.

If have strong feels about our town map, let us know, [we'd love your feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FG6_gaNWk_OLEnSMwQ76oXnDM4bpMlhF-pu0aA-s_zw/viewform?c=0&w=1).
