We're very happy to bring you a new set of spots this week. We're constantly listening to your recommendations and adding new places. Here's a quick rundown of what's new:

###Burgers
<br />
[Taproom](https://godaytrip.com/spots/taproom) in San Marcos<br />
They have a guacamole queso burger that we're dying to try. They also have 42 beers on tap, so it's definitely a great place to hang out.

[Dave's Burger Barn](https://godaytrip.com/spots/dave-s-burger-barn) in Waco<br />
Who wants to go for the Zipper Ripper (pictured above)?

[Burger University](https://godaytrip.com/spots/burger-university) in Georgetown<br />
A great place to grab a burger in Georgetown's beautiful downtown square. Stay tuned - we have some more [Georgetown](https://godaytrip.com/towns/georgetown) spots coming soon.

###Wineries
<br />
[Georgetown Winery](https://godaytrip.com/spots/georgetown-winery) in Georgetown<br />
Another downtown gem! Georgetown is shaping up to be a great trip that's really close and easy to get to.

###BBQ
<br />
[HWY 29 BBQ](https://godaytrip.com/spots/hwy-29-bbq) in Betram<br />
We've got a couple of great new BBQ spots in the [Burnet](https://godaytrip.com/towns/burnet) area. Hit them up after a trip to [Inks Lake](https://godaytrip.com/spots/inks-lake-state-park).

[Payne's Bar-B-Q Shak](https://godaytrip.com/spots/payne-s-bar-b-q-shak) in Burnet<br />
Definitely wins the award for best hand-painted fence (pictured above).

###Music
<br />
[Nutty Brown Cafe](https://godaytrip.com/spots/nutty-brown-cafe-ampitheater) in Dripping Springs<br />
It's technically in Austin, but we think it'd be a great part of a day trip to [Dripping Springs](https://godaytrip.com/towns/dripping-springs). Adding [Salt Lick](https://godaytrip.com/spots/the-salt-lick) and [Jester King](https://godaytrip.com/spots/jester-king-brewery) would make a p perfect day if you ask us.

[Mercer Street Dance Hall](https://godaytrip.com/spots/mercer-street-dance-hall) in Dripping Springs<br />
We're excited about all the places we've discovered out in Dripping Springs. It's such an easy drive. Stay tuned for more.

As always, keep your [recommendations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p1ZOjZuxCkEjNFhlymLtkas4x_Nms1sCQnaRSrzPKAM/viewform?c=0&w=1) coming.
