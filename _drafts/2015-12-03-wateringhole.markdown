There's nothing like finding a nice spot to relax for a beer after a long day of hiking or swimming. While breweries are always a great choice, they can sometimes have weird hours or be too far out of the way. We think our new [watering hole](https://godaytrip.com/categories/watering-holes) category will be just what the doctor ordered. Here are a few things we took into consideration when picking the perfect one:


Easy to get to  
Close to other spots  
Great local beer selection (bonus points for brewing their own beer)    
Margaritas  
Plenty of outdoor seating  
Misters and/or fans outside        
Outdoor games like washers or cornhole  
A place for the kids to run around (bonus points for a playscape)  
Great views  
Some food to nibble on  
Friendly, laid-back staff  
Fire pits  
Live music  
Local establishment (no chains)        
Pet friendly  

As always, [let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p1ZOjZuxCkEjNFhlymLtkas4x_Nms1sCQnaRSrzPKAM/viewform?c=0&w=1) if we misssed a spot.
