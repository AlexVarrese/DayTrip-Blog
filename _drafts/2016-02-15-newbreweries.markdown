(Clockwise from top left: [Rentsch Brewery](https://godaytrip.com/spots/rentsch), [Thirsty Planet Brewering Company](https://godaytrip.com/spots/thirsty-planet-brewing-company), and [Last Stand Brewing Company](https://godaytrip.com/spots/last-stand-brewing-company))

Breweries have always been one of our favorite categories, and we're happy to add three new ones to the mix. [Last Stand Brewing Company](https://godaytrip.com/spots/last-stand-brewing-company) opened it's doors in 2015, and is only a mile past [Jester King](https://godaytrip.com/spots/jester-king-brewery) on Fitzhugh Road. It was recently voted the "Best New Brewery" by the Austin Beer Guide. After adding Last Stand, we decided to go ahead and add [Thirsty Planet Brewering Company](https://godaytrip.com/spots/thirsty-planet-brewing-company) as well. Although technically in Austin, it's right off Highway 290 on the way to Jester King and Last Stand. We think it would make a killer trifecta of breweries to visit on a lazy Saturday.

Rentsch Brewery is a new up-and-coming brewery in Georgetown, also opening in 2015. We think it would be a great 1-2 punch with [600 Degrees Pizzeria & Drafthouse](https://godaytrip.com/spots/600-degrees-pizzeria-drafthouse).
